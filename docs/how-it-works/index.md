# Overview

Automated tools give developers accurate security context at different phases of development without the need to become a dedicated security expert. Choose the part of development that you are securing:
 
- During testing, a monitoring agent works inside the application to gather accurate security information from running APIs.
- In production, a performance-optimized security agent works inside the application to defend specific APIs against specific threats.
