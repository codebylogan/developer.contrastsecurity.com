# Collaboration

Security teams can collaborate with developers by giving them self-service tools that are easy to use, fast to run, and accurate on results.

Development and Security teams can collaborate by integrating tools to generate findings, then planning work around those findings, where planning is independent or joint.

## Security Teams
- Provide the tooling and internal support.
- Provide consultations and expertise to understand "security" in context.
- Help monitor and plan remediation goals of identified security issues.

## Development Teams
- Integrate tools into the proper SDLC location.
- Integrate findings into tools like defect tracking to plan ahead.
- Remediate/fix security issues per tool/security guidance.
