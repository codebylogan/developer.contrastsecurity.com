# Collaboration

Security teams can collaborate with developers by giving them self-service tools that are easy to use, fast to run, and accurate on results.

## Become a toolsmith

Becoming a toolsmith means giving developers tools that automate as many security practices as possible and then providing you expersite for anything further. This frees security teams to focus on business logic concerns beyond what software can understand on its own.

### What security teams do
- Provide the tooling and internal support.
- Provide consultations and expertise to understand "security" in context.
- Help monitor and plan remediation goals of identified security issues.

### What development teams do
- Integrate tools into the proper SDLC location.
- Integrate findings into tools like defect tracking to plan ahead.
- Remediate/fix security issues per tool/security guidance.
