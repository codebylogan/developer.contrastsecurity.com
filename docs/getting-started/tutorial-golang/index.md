# Securing Go Applications

Contrast provides sensors for Go applications that work inside the application to gather accurate security information from the executing APIs.

The agent works by integrating into the build phase, adding sensors at compile-time. After testing, teams deploy a separate build of the applicatio that does not contain these sensors.
