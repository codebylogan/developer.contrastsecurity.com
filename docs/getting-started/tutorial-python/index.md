# Securing Python Applications

Contrast offers a custom agent, available through [PyPI](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/install-python-with-pypi.html) that wraps security-sensitive functions at runtime. When functions are called, the agent doe a relevant security action to log or check data and then passes arguments to the original function for the application to execute.
