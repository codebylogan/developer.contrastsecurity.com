# Securing Java Applications

Automated tools give developers accurate security context at different phases of development without the need to become a dedicated security expert. Choose the part of development that you are securing:

- At [build time](securing-build-time), tools can analyze dependencies to find vulnerable components (keeping risk out) and scan code to find custom vulnerabilities.
- During [testing](iast-security), a monitoring agent works inside the application to gather accurate security information from running APIs.
- In production, a performance-optimized security agent works inside the application to defend specific APIs against specific threats.
