title: Results API
---

Use the Contrast API to pull your results and integrate with any new sets of tools.
The API lets you access result data the same as you would through your browser.

[API Documentation](https://api.contrastsecurity.com)

API SDK libraries:
- [Java SDK](https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/contrast-sdk-java)
- [.NET SDK](https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/contrast-sdk-dotnet)
- [Python SDK](https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/contrast-sdk-python)
- [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/contrast-sdk-javascript)
- [Ruby SDK](https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/contrast-sdk-ruby)

For additional details beyond the documentation and SDKs, simply open browser development tools as you use the UI.
Locate screens that use the data you want to pull as one way of figuring out which API you want.
