# Common Active Defenses

There are a few ways that organizations defend public-facing applications:

- *Web Application Firewalls (WAF)* provide a front-level defense for web applications.
- *Runtime Application Self Protection* provides a code API defense
- *DoS Prevention* defends against network-level denial of service attacks that attempt to overload applications. Some organizations use _load balancers_,  _WAFs_, and _content delivery networks (CDN)_ for similar actions.
