# Regular Expression Denial of Service

## What is Regular Expression Delial of Service (ReDoS)

Regular Expression Denial of Service occurs when attackers can control either the regular expression or data in a way that intentionally generates performance bad enough to harm system availability.

## When can ReDoS affect my application

ReDoS impacts applications that parse data with regular expressions and is most common in regular expressions with back references.

## How do I know if/where my application has a ReDoS vulnerability

Contrast Assess can detect ReDoS vulnerabilities at test time.

## How do I fix ReDoS

Developers should not permit remote users to control the regular expression itself. The developer should provide the regular expression, which can be improved as needed.

## How do people attack X flaws

When attackers can control a regular expression, they can submit a regex and data that will consume 100% CPU and block all other operations.
The following code [attempts to validate an email address](https://blog.superhuman.com/how-to-eliminate-regular-expression-denial-of-service/) but also locks a system up completely.
```regex
/("[^"]*"|[^@])*@[^@]*/
```
