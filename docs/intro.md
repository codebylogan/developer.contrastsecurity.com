# Security from the inside-out

Contrast offers developer-oriented security tools that enable developers to find their own security issues through automation rather than waiting on ivory-tower experts.

## Integrated Security Testing (in testing)

An automated security agent works inside the application to find security issues based on how the code runs. By monitoring code execution, integrated security testing is over 90% more accurate than other techniques.

## Composition and Static Analysis (in build)

Two automated tools run at build time:
- Dependency Analyers create a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to identify if the application contains vulnerable components.
- Static analysis analyzes the code and binaries to determine if the custom code or library combinations introduce any new vulnerable paths.
